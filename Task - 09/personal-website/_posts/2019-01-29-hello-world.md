# Experience:
As a student with no basic knowlegde about *coding* and how to do the tasks at first I was a bit worried whether I will be able to complete the given tasks or not.

After looking at the tasks I was afraid. But slowly as I learned some asics of code and how everything works I got a bit of confidence.

  The meeting of our club that explained how to do the stuff like linux, vscode, git, github, etc. This helped me in starting my tasks. Now I was able to start doing my tasks. Now i completed the following tasks:

- Task-00 : Installing ubuntu
- Task-01 : Starring all amFOSS repos
- Task-02 : Basics of terminal in ubuntu
- Task-05 : LetMeSee.c
- Task-09 : Personal Website
- Task-14 : Bandit Overthewire



Using Stackoverflow and googling the stuff helped me alot in learning all these new stuff.
