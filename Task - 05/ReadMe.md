# Let Me See

This was my first time looking a huge **c language ** code .
I tried to do some stuff on my own at first. I was able to debug some of the code before i learnt about c and c++ from the Cs50 videos.
But after debugging some of the code i was stuck with some errors after taking some tips from Mentors i was finally able to completely debug the file.
