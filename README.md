## My views about the tasks
As I was new to coding it took me more time to complete some of the tasks. 

Basically the tasks were all new to me and I was able to enjoy doing every task.
I  was stuck at some tasks for lot of time but still I was able to complete some of the tasks. Attempting all these tasks made me feel that I have a lot to learn and having put effort to solve these tasks it was very fun,frustrating,happy and sad.

The way of self learning to complete all these tasks is amazing. I learned many new things from these tasks I hope Ill be able to complete all of the tasks that I was unable to complete in the future.

Not giving up while doing these tasks was the best thing.
## My Introduction
Hii Seniors :pray: :smile: I am Siddharth Reddy Anthireddy from Warangal Telangana.I came to know about amFOSS from a family friend i was very intrigued since then.

I feel the club will provide me various new things to learn in coding world and oppurtunities to do various projects, hackathons and open source contribution.

I am new to coding and i started to learn new things on various websites to learn coding as soon as i got a laptop. But after attempting these tasks i came to know what all I'm new to this and all the new thng that i have to learn. These tasks were so intresting that I whenever I open laptop and used to try tasks all day and nights(Ofcourse I listened to classes and had sufficient sleep :grin: ). 

Doing these tasks made me learn many new things and found that I'm improving on daily basis. This type of work was what I was looking for since a long time.
