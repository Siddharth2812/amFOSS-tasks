# Introspection:

## Why must you choose me?



## How would I contribute to the club?




## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Working for the tasks made me realize where I was weak and need improvement and what all things I needed to learn.
Im planning on doing the following things:
- Get good at python and java/c.
- Learn DSA.
- Work on a project (web or app developement).
- Participate in hackathons.
- Maintaing good scores in academics.
- 



## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

As of now the recuiting procees is very nice.
The introduction of the tasks in the hactoberfest was amazing and I want to thank the seniors who took their time to help us.
