# Introspection:

## Why must you choose me?
whenever I starded doing the works I feel I have to give it my all and do the work. Similarly when I started doing the tasks I gave my all to  learn what i have to do. Doing the tasks I found my younger self who was very intrested in coding and software work in me beginning to feel happy about me going in the path I once wished to be in. I felt that coding was my passion while doing the tasks. I feel a new energy flowing while coding. 


## How would I contribute to the club?
After working for the tasks I found that I'm going to work my fullest to complete all the future s



## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Working for the tasks made me realize where I was weak and need improvement and what all things I needed to learn.
Im planning on doing the following things:
